# Anobi Marketing Portal

This repository contains a small Flask web application for marketers. The app
includes a simple login system, an about page explaining the benefits of the
portal, a dashboard showing sample marketing news and posting times and a basic
AI chat interface implemented with simple rules.  The user interface uses the
Materialize CSS theme to provide smooth visuals.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

The server will start on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

Once running you can visit `/about` to read more about the portal.
